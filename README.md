# My Reading List
---

As a child I liked reading books but then over the years I lost the habit. Then a friend gifted me a book on my birthday and it helped me rediscover reading. There were two other factors that helped me get back to reading:

1. The Covid lockdowns of 2020 provided a little more time at hand. I could give time and energy to things I really wanted to do.

1. One good  habit begets another, so as I started focussing more on physical fitness it had other positive side effects. I thought what else could I accomplish that I never thought possible, getting back to reading was a long standing desire.

Hop over to [https://aarora79.github.io/my-reading-list/](https://aarora79.github.io/my-reading-list/) to see my reading list and some analytics about it. 

Initially I thought I will make a simple Markdown list in a README.md file which has a list of books, but then I ended up using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) over a few hours on a weekend to create a site hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#:~:text=There%20are%20three%20ways%20to,publish%20from%20the%20docs%20directory.).
