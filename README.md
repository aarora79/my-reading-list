# My Reading List
---

As a child I liked reading books but then over the years I lost the habit. Then a friend gifted me a book on my birthday and it helped me rediscover reading. There were two other factors that helped me get back to reading, 1/ I had a little more time at hand due to Covid lockdowns and 2/ As they say one good habit begets another, so as I focussed more on physical fitness it had other positive side effects, reading more was one of them (I felt what else could I accomplish that I never thought possible).
