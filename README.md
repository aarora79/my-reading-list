# My Reading List
---

As a child I liked reading books but then over the years I lost the habit. Then a friend gifted me a book on my birthday and it helped me rediscover reading. There were two other factors that helped me get back to reading:

1. The Covid lockdowns of 2020 provided a little more time at hand. I could give time and energy to things I really wanted to do.

1. One good  habit begets another, so as I started focussing more on physical fitness it had other positive side effects. I thought what else could I accomplish that I never thought possible, getting back to reading was a long standing desire.
